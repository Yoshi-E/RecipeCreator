      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <p>Cooking recipes are something almost everybody knows, and will encounter on a regular basis in the mundane life.<br>
        However finding, managing and creating recipes is often a difficult and tedious task.
        Many, will simply use their notes app on their phone, or MS Word on their computer to write down the instructions and ingredients.<br>
        <br>
        This project aims to explore technical methods, namly natural language processing, to process and aid in the creation and classification of cooking recipes.
